		<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
		<p class="text-container">
			I'm a software engineer with nearly 20 years of professional experience
			excited by learning every day.<br />
			I love solving real world problems in practical ways.<br />
			I think you can find the right solution only digging underlying
			requirements and understanding tradeoffs.
		</p>
		<h2>My history</h2>
		<p class="text-container">
			I'm a <span class="kw">tech and science enthusiast</span> since very young
			age.<br />
			Later I focused my passion mainly on physics and informatics.<br />
			I started my freelance career before completing college studies in physics
			then I come back and took my
			<span class="kw">Master Degree with honours</span>.<br />
			But academic research was too slow for my needs so informatics became my
			career path.<br />
			I started as Linux system administrator and network specialist and later
			on I moved to software development.<br />
			In late 2000s I was searching for bigger ventures but remote jobs wasn't
			much of a thing and relocating was out of my possibilities.<br />
			With a good idea, after more than a year of struggle with bureaucracy, in
			2011 a friend and I <span class="kw">founded a start-up</span>.<br />
			After a good start things started to go south and in 2015 we shut it down
			for good.<br />
			In 2016 I entered in Food s.r.l., a media company that wanted greatly
			accelerate its digital transition. I was assigned with
			<span class="kw">tech lead</span> and tasked to build a team and shape the
			technological backbone of the company.<br />
			4 years later company's digital offer, internal automation and data
			integration <span class="kw">expanded many fold</span> continuing to spin
			up new projects and functionalities.
		</p>

		<h2>How do I approach software development?</h2>
		<p class="text-container">
			I <span class="kw">unearth needs</span> and opportunities under requests
			and problems.<br />
			I elaborate possibly radically
			<span class="kw">different solutions</span> and for each one I
			<span class="kw">present tradeoffs</span> together with my advices.<br />
			I develop the chosen solution by myself, together with the team or
			coordinating other developers and suppliers if I'm in charge.<br />
			In latest years I focused on
			<span class="kw">architectural choices</span>,
			<span class="kw">backend development</span> and
			<span class="kw">management</span> but when needed I develop frontend
			too.<br />
			I like to dirt my hands at solving problems.
